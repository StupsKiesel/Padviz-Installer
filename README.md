Padviz Installer

I packed the normal Padviz ( Orginal Source: https://github.com/piatf/padviz )
to a standalone program via auto-py-to-exe,
and build a litle installer around.

My reason for doing this is:
Everyone can now use this program with only one click,
to get the orginal runing you needed to install Python27, PyGame and SDLlib
this is very complicated for a normal person who only wants to get a Controller Display.
